# Introduction

Baltimore's Trash Wheel project represents an innovative and vital environmental initiative aimed at tackling urban water pollution. Launched in 2014 by the Waterfront Partnership of Baltimore with support from the Maryland Port Administration, the project uses solar and hydro-powered devices known as Trash Wheels to intercept and remove trash from rivers and streams before it can reach the Chesapeake Bay. To date, these devices have collected over one million pounds of debris, including plastic bottles, polystyrene containers, and cigarette butts, which are notorious for harming aquatic life and polluting urban waters.

The dataset, `trashwheel.csv`, chronicles the daily operations of these Trash Wheels. It meticulously records the volume and weight of trash collected, categorized by type and indexed by date, across multiple locations in Baltimore. This data not only underscores the operational success of the Trash Wheels but also highlights seasonal and event-driven fluctuations in urban waste generation and collection.

## Importance of the Dataset

This dataset is crucial for several reasons:

- **Environmental Impact**: It provides empirical evidence of the quantity and types of urban waste that can be intercepted from urban waterways, offering insights into the effectiveness of innovative pollution control technologies.
- **Policy and Planning**: By analyzing trends and patterns in the data, policymakers and urban planners can better understand the sources and scales of water pollution, leading to more targeted and effective environmental regulations and initiatives.
- **Public Awareness and Education**: Disseminating findings from this data can enhance public awareness about the impact of littering and the benefits of recycling, potentially fostering more environmentally responsible behaviors.

## Challenges Associated with the Dataset

Despite the value of this dataset, several issues warrant attention when interpreting its findings:

- **Completeness**: There are gaps in the dataset on days when the Trash Wheels were inactive due to maintenance or operational issues, which could skew analysis of long-term trends.
- **Accuracy**: The potential for human error in data entry and variations in the accuracy of measurement methods might affect the reliability of the data.
- **Consistency**: Over the years, modifications to data collection methodologies might have introduced inconsistencies that complicate comparisons over time.
- **Environmental Biases**: External factors such as weather conditions—particularly heavy rainfalls that can spike debris flow—need to be considered as they can significantly influence the volume of waste collected.

These factors must be carefully considered to ensure that the analysis remains robust and that conclusions drawn are both reliable and actionable. The subsequent sections of this document will delve into a detailed examination of the dataset using statistical methods and visualizations to assess the efficacy and impact of the Trash Wheel project on Baltimore's urban waterways.
